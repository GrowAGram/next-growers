## What is GrowAGram?

Welcome to our cannabis home cultivation community! Explore helpful tips, guides, and experiences for successful cannabis cultivation. Dive into the world of cannabis cultivation and learn all about strains, growing environments, care tips, and much more.

If you're passionate about or just getting started with cannabis cultivation, we invite you to explore our community.

As the legalization of cannabis in Germany draws closer, we believe it is important to establish a community that celebrates the plant and its unique growth process. We are currently in the alpha version and appreciate feedback and active participation.
