<h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>
<h3>Data protection</h3>
<p>
  The operators of this website and its pages take the protection of
  your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data
  as confidential information and in compliance with the statutory data
  protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
</p>
<p>
  Whenever you use this website, a variety of personal information will
  be collected. Personal data comprises data that can be used to
  personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains
  which data we collect as well as the purposes we use this data for. It
  also explains how, and for which purpose the information is collected.
</p>
<p>
  We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet
  (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be prone to security gaps.
  It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party
  access.
</p>
<h3>
  Information about the responsible party (referred to as the
  &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)
</h3>
<p>The data processing controller on this website is:</p>
<p>
  Henning Sieh - IT Beratung<br />
  Espenpfad 6<br />
  63477 Maintal
</p>

<p>
  The controller is the natural person or legal entity that
  single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions as to the
  purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g.,
  names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
</p>

<h3>Storage duration</h3>
<p>
  Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this
  privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the
  purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a
  justified request for deletion or revoke your consent to data
  processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
  permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or
  commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion
  will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
</p>
<h3>
  General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this
  website
</h3>
<p>
  If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal
  data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if
  special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1)
  DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal
  data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49
  (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the
  access to information in your end device (e.g., via device
  fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect;
  25 (1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is
  required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation
  of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art.
  6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the
  fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art.
  6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on
  the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
  Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is
  provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.
</p>
<h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
<p>
  In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various
  external parties. In some cases, this also requires the transfer of
  personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal
  data to external parties if this is required as part of the
  fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
  disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate
  interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR, or if
  another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using
  processors, we only disclose personal data of our customers on the
  basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint
  processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
</p>
<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
<p>
  A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject
  to your express consent. You can also revoke at any time any consent
  you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the
  lawfulness of any data collection that occurred prior to your
  revocation.
</p>
<h3>
  Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
  object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
</h3>
<p>
  IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR
  (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
  OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
  SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE
  PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF
  DATA IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU
  LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL
  DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION
  WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR
  INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
  THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION
  PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
</p>
<p>
  IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
  ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR
  AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY
  TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS
  AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL
  DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING
  PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
</p>
<h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
<p>
  In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
  log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
  state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
  the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
  complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
  proceedings available as legal recourses.
</p>
<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
<p>
  You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the
  basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to
  you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you
  should demand the direct transfer of the data to another controller,
  this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
</p>
<h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
<p>
  Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
  right to demand information about your archived personal data, their
  source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your
  data at any time. You may also have a right to have your data
  rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject
  matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not
  hesitate to contact us at any time.
</p>
<h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
<p>
  You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
  the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
  contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing
  applies in the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
    archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
    During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the
    right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal
    data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
    unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of
    the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of
    this data.
  </li>
  <li>
    If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
    exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
    demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data
    instead of its eradication.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your
    rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
    long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
    the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
    data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these
  data &ndash; with the exception of their archiving &ndash; may be
  processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend
  legal entitlements or to protect the rights of other natural persons
  or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited by
  the European Union or a member state of the EU.
</p>
<h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
<p>
  For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
  content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
  website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
  program. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
  the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to
  &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in
  the browser line.
</p>
<p>
  If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
  cannot be read by third parties.
</p>
<h3>Rejection of unsolicited e-mails</h3>
<p>
  We herewith object to the use of contact information published in
  conjunction with the mandatory information to be provided in our Site
  Notice to send us promotional and information material that we have
  not expressly requested. The operators of this website and its pages
  reserve the express right to take legal action in the event of the
  unsolicited sending of promotional information, for instance via SPAM
  messages.
</p>
<h2>4. Recording of data on this website</h2>
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>
  Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as
  &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data packages that do not
  cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily
  for the duration of a session (session cookies) or they are
  permanently archived on your device (permanent cookies). Session
  cookies are automatically deleted once you terminate your visit.
  Permanent cookies remain archived on your device until you actively
  delete them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.
</p>
<p>
  Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party
  companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable
  the integration of certain services of third-party companies into
  websites (e.g., cookies for handling payment services).
</p>
<p>
  Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically
  essential since certain website functions would not work in the
  absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the
  display of videos). Other cookies may be used to analyze user behavior
  or for promotional purposes.
</p>
<p>
  Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic
  communication transactions, for the provision of certain functions you
  want to use (e.g., for the shopping cart function) or those that are
  necessary for the optimization (required cookies) of the website
  (e.g., cookies that provide measurable insights into the web
  audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, unless a
  different legal basis is cited. The operator of the website has a
  legitimate interest in the storage of required cookies to ensure the
  technically error-free and optimized provision of the operator&rsquo;s
  services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies and similar
  recognition technologies has been requested, the processing occurs
  exclusively on the basis of the consent obtained (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR
  and &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG); this consent may be revoked at any time.
</p>
<p>
  You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you
  will be notified any time cookies are placed and to permit the
  acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the
  acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the
  delete-function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the
  browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this
  website may be limited.
</p>
<p>
  Which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in
  this privacy policy.
</p>
<h3>Server log files</h3>
<p>
  The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and
  stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser
  communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
  <li>The used operating system</li>
  <li>Referrer URL</li>
  <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
  <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
  <li>The IP address</li>
</ul>
<p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
<p>
  This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The operator
  of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically error free
  depiction and the optimization of the operator&rsquo;s website. In
  order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.
</p>
<h3>Request by e-mail, telephone, or fax</h3>
<p>
  If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including
  all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and
  processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not
  pass these data on without your consent.
</p>
<p>
  These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your
  inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required for
  the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
  data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the
  effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or
  on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if it has been
  obtained; the consent can be revoked at any time.
</p>
<p>
  The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until
  you request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the
  purpose for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your
  request). Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory
  retention periods - remain unaffected.
</p>
<h3>Communication via Signal</h3>
Among other means, we use the instant messaging service Signal to
communicate with our customers and other third parties. The provider is
Privacy Signal Messenger, LLC 650 Castro Street, Suite 120-223 Mountain
View, CA 94041 (hereinafter &ldquo;Signal&rdquo;).
<p>
  Communication takes place via end-to-end encryption (peer-to-peer),
  which prevents Signal or other third parties from gaining access to
  the communication content. However, Signal receives access to
  technical data that is generated during the communication process
  (e.g. Auth Tokens, Keys, Push Tokens).
</p>
<p>
  Further details on data processing can be found in Signal's privacy
  policy at:
  <a
    href="https://signal.org/legal/#privacy-policy"
    target="_blank"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >https://signal.org/legal/#privacy-policy</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  Signal is used on the basis of our legitimate interest in
  communicating as quickly and effectively as possible with customers,
  interested parties and other business and contractual partners (Art.
  6(1)(f) GDPR). If a corresponding consent has been requested, the data
  processing takes place exclusively on the basis of the consent; this
  can be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
</p>
<p>
  The communication content exchanged between you and us on Signal will
  remain with us until you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to
  storage or the purpose for data storage no longer applies (e.g. after
  your request has been processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - in
  particular retention periods - remain unaffected.

  The data processing associated with Google&rsquo;s registration is
  based on our legitimate interest in making the registration process as

<p>
  As a user of this website, you have the option to subscribe to
  comments after you have registered. You will receive a confirmation

  holder of the provided e-mail address. You can deactivate this
  function at any time by following a respective link in the information
  e-mails. The data entered in conjunction with subscriptions to
  comments will be deleted in this case. However, if you have
  communicated this information to us for other purposes and from a
  different location (e.g., when subscribing to the newsletter), the
  data shall remain in our possession.
</p>
<h4>Storage period for comments</h4>
<p>
  Comments and any affiliated information shall be stored by us and
  remain on this website until the content the comment pertained to has

  Comments are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR).
  You have the right to revoke at any time any consent you have already
  given us. To do so, all you are required to do is sent us an informal
  notification via e-mail. This shall be without prejudice to the

<h3>Gravatar</h3>
<p>
  We have integrated Gravatar on this website. The provider is
  Automattic Inc., 60 29th Street #343, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA
  (hereinafter Gravatar).
</p>
<p>
  Gravatar is a tool that lets you provide personal images (avatars) to
  users of our website. The avatars serve as visual representations of
  the users and are displayed wherever a user interacts with the
  platform (e.g., in forums or chats). When a user interacts with the
  platform, their avatar is displayed based on the choices associated
  with their email address. This adds a personal touch to the users'
  online presence and simplifies the identification process, as the
  selected image is associated with the users when they are active
  online.
</p>
<p>
  When commenting or interacting on our website with Gravatar enabled,
  the hash of the email address of the user using Gravatar (used as an
  ID) is processed by Gravatar.
</p>
<p>
  The use of Gravatar is based on Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR. The website
  operator has a legitimate interest in an appealing presentation of its
  forums. Insofar as a corresponding consent was requested, the
  processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 (1)(a)
  GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG. This consent can be revoked at any time.

<h2>6. Newsletter</h2>
<h3>Newsletter data</h3>
<p>
  If you would like to subscribe to the newsletter offered on this
  website, we will need from you an e-mail address as well as
  information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the
  e-mail address provided and consent to the receipt of the newsletter.
  No further data shall be collected or shall be collected only on a
  voluntary basis. We shall use such data only for the sending of the
  requested information and shall not share such data with any third
  parties.
</p>
<p>
  The processing of the information entered into the newsletter
  subscription form shall occur exclusively on the basis of your consent
  (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You may revoke the consent you have given to the
  archiving of data, the e-mail address, and the use of this information
  for the sending of the newsletter at any time, for instance by
  clicking on the &ldquo;Unsubscribe&rdquo; link in the newsletter. This
  shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any data processing
  transactions that have taken place to date.
</p>
<p>
  The data deposited with us for the purpose of subscribing to the
  newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the
  newsletter or the newsletter service provider and deleted from the
  newsletter distribution list after you unsubscribe from the newsletter
  or after the purpose has ceased to apply. We reserve the right to
  delete or block e-mail addresses from our newsletter distribution list
  at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest in
  accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
</p>
<p>Data stored for other purposes with us remain unaffected.</p>
<p>
  After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your
  e-mail address may be stored by us or the newsletter service provider
  in a blacklist, if such action is necessary to prevent future
  mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose
  and not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our
  interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending
  newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f)
  GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is indefinite.
  <strong
    >You may object to the storage if your interests outweigh our
    legitimate interest.</strong

</p>
<h3>Newsletter mailing to existing customers</h3>
<p>
  If you order goods or services from us and enter your e-mail address,
  this e-mail address may subsequently be used by us to send you
  newsletters, provided we inform you of this in advance. In such a
  case, only direct advertising for our own similar goods or services
  will be sent via the newsletter. You can unsubscribe from this
  newsletter at any time. There is a corresponding link in every
  newsletter for this purpose. In this case, the legal basis for sending
  the newsletter is Art. 6 (1)(f) GDPR in conjunction with Section 7 (3)
  UWG.
</p>
<p>
  After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, we may
  store your email address in a blacklist to prevent future mailings to
  you. The data from the blacklist will only be used for this purpose
  and will not be merged with other data. This serves both your interest
  and our interest in complying with the legal requirements when sending
  newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1)(f)
  GDPR). Storage in the blacklist is not limited in time. You can object
  to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.

<h3>YouTube with expanded data protection integration</h3>
<p>
  This website integrates videos from the YouTube website. The operator
  of the website is Google Ireland Limited (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;),
  Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
</p>
<p>
  When you visit one of these websites on which YouTube is integrated, a
  connection to the YouTube servers is established. This tells the
  YouTube server which of our pages you have visited. If you are logged
  into your YouTube account, you enable YouTube to assign your surfing
  behavior directly to your personal profile. You can prevent this by
  logging out of your YouTube account.
</p>
<p>
  We use YouTube in extended data protection mode. According to YouTube,
  videos that are played in extended data protection mode are not used
  to personalize browsing on YouTube. Ads that are played in extended
  data protection mode are also not personalized. No cookies are set in
  extended data protection mode. Instead, so-called local storage
  elements are stored in the user's browser, which contain personal data
  similar to cookies and can be used for recognition. Details on the
  extended data protection mode can be found here:

</p>
<p>
  After activating a YouTube video, further data processing operations
  may be triggered over which we have no influence.
</p>
<p>
  The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online
  content in an appealing manner. Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is
  a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the
  processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a)
  GDPR and &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG, insofar the consent includes the storage
  of cookies or the access to information in the user&rsquo;s end device
  (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDDG. This
  consent can be revoked at any time.

</p>
<p>
  Whenever you visit one of our pages featuring Vimeo videos, a
  connection with the servers of Vimeo is established. In conjunction
  with this, the Vimeo server receives information about which of our
  sites you have visited. Vimeo also receives your IP address. However,
  we have set up Vimeo in such a way that Vimeo cannot track your user
  activities and does not place any cookies.
</p>
<p>
  We use Vimeo to make our online presentation attractive for you. This
  is a legitimate interest on our part pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. If
  a respective declaration of consent was requested (e.g. concerning the
  storage of cookies), processing shall occur exclusively on the basis
  of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR; the given consent may be revoked at any time.
</p>
<p>
  Data transmission to the US is based on the Standard Contractual
  Clauses (SCC) of the European Commission and, according to Vimeo, on

</p>
<p>
  To do this, the browser you use will have to establish a connection

<h2>8. eCommerce and payment service providers</h2>
<h3>Processing of Customer and Contract Data</h3>
<p>
  We collect, process, and use personal customer and contract data for
  the establishment, content arrangement and modification of our
  contractual relationships. Data with personal references to the use of
  this website (usage data) will be collected, processed, and used only
  if this is necessary to enable the user to use our services or

  Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
</p>
<p>
  The collected customer data shall be deleted upon completion of the

  of any existing statutory archiving periods. This shall be without
  prejudice to any statutory archiving periods.
</p>
<h3>
  Data transfer upon closing of contracts for online stores, retailers,
  and the shipment of merchandise
</h3>
<p>
  Whenever you order merchandise from us, we will share your personal
  data with the transportation company entrusted with the delivery as
  well as the payment service commissioned to handle the payment
  transactions. Only the data these respective service providers require
  to meet their obligations will be shared. The legal basis for this
  sharing is Art. 6 (1)(b) GDPR, which permits the processing of data
  for the fulfillment of contractual or pre-contractual obligations. If
  you give us your respective consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1)(a) GDPR, we
  will share your email address with the transportation company
  entrusted with the delivery so that this company can notify you on the
  shipping status for your order via email. You have the option to

  financial institution tasked with the processing of payments.
</p>

  Any further transfer of data shall not occur or shall only occur if
  you have expressly consented to the transfer. Any sharing of your data
  with third parties in the absence of your express consent, for

<h2>9. Online-based Audio and Video Conferences (Conference tools)</h2>
<h4>Data processing</h4>
<p>
  We use online conference tools, among other things, for communication
  with our customers. The tools we use are listed in detail below. If
  you communicate with us by video or audio conference using the
  Internet, your personal data will be collected and processed by the
  provider of the respective conference tool and by us. The conferencing
  tools collect all information that you provide/access to use the tools
  (email address and/or your phone number). Furthermore, the conference
  tools process the duration of the conference, start and end (time) of
  participation in the conference, number of participants and other
  &ldquo;context information&rdquo; related to the communication process
  (metadata).
</p>
<p>
  Furthermore, the provider of the tool processes all the technical data
  required for the processing of the online communication. This
  includes, in particular, IP addresses, MAC addresses, device IDs,
  device type, operating system type and version, client version, camera
  type, microphone or loudspeaker and the type of connection.
</p>
<p>
  Should content be exchanged, uploaded, or otherwise made available
  within the tool, it is also stored on the servers of the tool
  provider. Such content includes, but is not limited to, cloud
  recordings, chat/ instant messages, voicemail uploaded photos and
  videos, files, whiteboards, and other information shared while using
  the service.
</p>
<p>
  Please note that we do not have complete influence on the data
  processing procedures of the tools used. Our possibilities are largely
  determined by the corporate policy of the respective provider. Further
  information on data processing by the conference tools can be found in
  the data protection declarations of the tools used, and which we have
  listed below this text.
</p>
<h4>Purpose and legal bases</h4>
<p>
  The conference tools are used to communicate with prospective or
  existing contractual partners or to offer certain services to our
  customers (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR). Furthermore, the use of the tools
  serves to generally simplify and accelerate communication with us or
  our company (legitimate interest in the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR).
  Insofar as consent has been requested, the tools in question will be
  used on the basis of this consent; the consent may be revoked at any
  time with effect from that date.
</p>
<h4>Duration of storage</h4>
<p>
  Data collected directly by us via the video and conference tools will
  be deleted from our systems immediately after you request us to delete
  it, revoke your consent to storage, or the reason for storing the data
  no longer applies. Stored cookies remain on your end device until you
  delete them. Mandatory legal retention periods remain unaffected.
</p>
<p>
  We have no influence on the duration of storage of your data that is
  stored by the operators of the conference tools for their own
  purposes. For details, please directly contact the operators of the
  conference tools.
